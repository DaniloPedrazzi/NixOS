  # ---------------- ENVIRONMENT ----------------

  gtk = {
    enable = true;
    cursorTheme = {

  # ---------------- OTHER STUFF ----------------
  # The home.packages option allows you to install Nix packages into your
  # environment.
  home.packages = [
    # # Adds the 'hello' command to your environment. It prints a friendly
    # # "Hello, world!" when run.
    # pkgs.hello

    # # It is sometimes useful to fine-tune packages, for example, by applying
    # # overrides. You can do that directly here, just don't forget the
    # # parentheses. Maybe you want to install Nerd Fonts with a limited number of
    # # fonts?
    # (pkgs.nerdfonts.override { fonts = [ "FantasqueSansMono" ]; })

    # # You can also create simple shell scripts directly inside your
    # # configuration. For example, this adds a command 'my-hello' to your
    # # environment:
    # (pkgs.writeShellScriptBin "my-hello" ''
    #   echo "Hello, ${config.home.username}!"
    # '')
  ];


  # Home Manager is pretty good at managing dotfiles. The primary way to manage
  # plain files is through 'home.file'.
  home.file = {
    # # Building this configuration will create a copy of 'dotfiles/screenrc' in
    # # the Nix store. Activating the configuration will then make '~/.screenrc' a
    # # symlink to the Nix store copy.
    # ".screenrc".source = dotfiles/screenrc;

    # # You can also set the file content immediately.
    # ".gradle/gradle.properties".text = ''
    #   org.gradle.console=verbose
    #   org.gradle.daemon.idletimeout=3600000
    # '';
  };


  # Home Manager can also manage your environment variables through
  # 'home.sessionVariables'. These will be explicitly sourced when using a
  # shell provided by Home Manager. If you don't want to manage your shell
  # through Home Manager then you have to manually source 'hm-session-vars.sh'
  # located at either
  #  ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh
  #  ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/profile/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh
  #  /etc/profiles/per-user/danilo/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh
  home.sessionVariables = {
    # EDITOR = "emacs";
  };


  # ---------------- HOME MANAGER SETTINGS----------------
  # Basic user settings
  home.username = "danilo";
  home.homeDirectory = "/home/danilo";

  # Do not change
  home.stateVersion = "25.05";

  # Let Home Manager install and manage itself.
  programs.home-manager.enable = true;
